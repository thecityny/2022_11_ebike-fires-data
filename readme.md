THE CITY analyzed this data and used it in writing the story "[Where and Why E-Bikes Catch Fire in NYC](https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/11/21/23468257/ebikes-fires-lithium-ion-batteries-delivery-workers)". 

In response to a FOIL request, investigative reporter Greg Smith received two PDF files from the New York City Fire Department. The files provide details about 294 structural fires caused by exploding lithium-ion batteries between Jan. 1, 2021 and Nov. 15, 2022. The details include the date, time, address, borough and ZIP code of each of the e-bike fires recorded in the 23 months.

THE CITY converted these PDFs into CSVs and combined them into a single file. We used [geocodio.io](https://www.geocod.io/) to generate coordinates for each address. We manually corrected address conversions with less than 100% accuracy using [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/search/Corona,+Queens,+NY/@40.74087105,-73.85709825,10.93805365a,3981.55465771d,35y,323.92901598h,45t,0r/data=Cn0aUxJNCiUweDg5YzI1ZmNjMzYyNjk0MDE6MHg1NGRkNmFiZTdhNjdiMTUwGZU9rrJbX0RAIbOsoA5Qd1LAKhJDb3JvbmEsIFF1ZWVucywgTlkYAiABIiYKJAn3KufJqXNEQBHRelz7Nt4pQBk4yFSeuwRjQCFdp-2JuO1gwA). 

In an interactive map published as part of our story, THE CITY mapped the coordinates of each fire to highlight where they happened.
