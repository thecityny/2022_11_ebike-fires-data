In response to a FOIL request, THE CITY's investigative reporter Greg Smith received two PDF files from the New York City Fire Department. The files provide details about 294 structural fires caused by exploding lithium-ion batteries between Jan. 1, 2021 and Nov. 15, 2022. The details include the date, time, address, borough and ZIP code of each of the e-bike fires recorded in the 23 months.

<code>Lithium Addresses 2022.pdf</code> lists year-to-date 2022 e-bike fires

THE CITY converted these PDFs to CSVs which were then combined into a single file. We used [geocodio.io](https://www.geocod.io/) to generate coordinates for each address. The address conversions with less than 100% accuracy were manually corrected by THE CITY's reporters using https://earth.google.com/web/search/Corona,+Queens,+NY/@40.74087105,-73.85709825,10.93805365a,3981.55465771d,35y,0h,45t,0r/data=Cn0aUxJNCiUweDg5YzI1ZmNjMzYyNjk0MDE6MHg1NGRkNmFiZTdhNjdiMTUwGZU9rrJbX0RAIbOsoA5Qd1LAKhJDb3JvbmEsIFF1ZWVucywgTlkYAiABIiYKJAn3KufJqXNEQBHRelz7Nt4pQBk4yFSeuwRjQCFdp-2JuO1gwCgC. 

THE CITY mapped the coordinates to highlight the distrution of these incidents.
